### Why
- to develop your package, to test code, to write documentation from 1 source of truth: your colab notebooks
- no beefy local computer needed, everything is computed with a colab notebook and stored on your Google drive

### How

Step0: clone this template to your github account.

Step1: create a new repo (e.g. name it 'my_amazing_project') using this template. 

Step2: to clone your newly created repo in your Google drive, use colab to open this notebook [git_clone_my_amazing_project_to_gdrive.ipynb](https://github.com/wjlgatech/nbdev_colab/blob/master/git_clone_my_amazing_project_to_gdrive.ipynb) and run it through.

Step3: to learn what to do next, start at notebook `nb/00_core.ipynb` from your Google Drive


Known bugs that need to be sorted (any help is welcome):

* ReadMe not updating after updating `index.ipynb`
